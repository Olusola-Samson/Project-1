## Dataset
This is a movie database which has complete and relevant data about movies.
There are 10866 observations and 21 fields of which is divided between 60% quantitative and 40% qualitative 


## Summary and Key Insight of Findings
 **Our focus will be on investigating few questions about this dataset. Especially movies made in the year 2015**
 
**The relationship between revenue and the ratings of movies in 2015  ,A lot of people feel like the more a movie makes at box office the higher the ratings of the movie should be.
However, most movies with a budget of $50,000,000 or more have an higher average rating than movies made with less.
Also movies with a higher budget(production cost) tend to have above average ratings and we can also see that the film with the highest rating doesn't have a higher budget or revenue.**
 
 **in conclusion, the higher the production cost or revenue of a movie does not really affect the ratings of the film** 
 
**From the analysis i undestand that popularity doesnt really affect how much a movie makes at the box office.
 Also, the populatrity of the highest grossing movie in the year 2015 is below average and most movies in the top ten too and it shows that only one movie in the top ten highest grossing movies have a high popularity.
 So in conclusion, it's safe to say that how well a movie does at the box office does not depend on the popularity.**
